# Travelbot Front-End
The files in this repository act as the front-end to host the results of my TravelBot application. For a detailed explanation and screenshots of this application, please have a look at the ReadMe file for the corresponding back-end repository located here (https://github.com/matty271828/travelbot):

This web application was built using an MVC model, utilising the web framework Flask as the controller. Custom HTML/CSS were used to develop the user-interface, as well as select elements from the CSS framework bootstrap. 

A file for submitting SQL queries to the central project database (shared by the two repositories) is included.

n.b. two separate repositories were utilised in order to make best use of Heroku.
