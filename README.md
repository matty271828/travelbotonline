# Travelbot Front-End
The files in this repository act as the front-end to host the results of my TravelBot application. For a detailed explanation and screenshots of this application, please have a look at the ReadMe file for the corresponding back-end repository located here (https://github.com/matty271828/travelbot):

n.b. two separate repositories were utilised in order to make best use of Heroku.
